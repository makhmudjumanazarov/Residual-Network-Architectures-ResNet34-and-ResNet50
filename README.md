# Building ResNet34 and ResNet50 models using Tensorflow(TF) from scratch

### Building a Residual Network

Residual networks solve degradation problem by shortcuts or skip connections, by short circuiting shallow layers to deep layers. We can stack Residual blocks more and more, without degradation in performance. This enables very deep networks to be built.
